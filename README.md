# Exercises App

This is a personal challenge. This app is being developed using Python Flask in
the backend, and the frontend will just be developed using JQuery. This is a
personal project which my purpose is just learning web development, however,
in the future I'd like to improve implementation, for example using a framework
for frontend (I am thinking trying reactJS or Vuejs). For now, I'd like to
feel myself how the frontend code grows exponentially while adding features.

Basically I am creating an exercises app with the following features:

* Exercises to be done at home
* Predefined exercises routines
* Keep track of progress
* Submit custom exercises routines

First commit. For now, the app only allows user sign-up and logging. I have
implemented REST API (not real REST) for basic functionality.
