# Exercises App

This is a personal challenge. This app is being developed using Python Flask in
the backend, and the frontend will just be developed using JQuery. This is a
personal project which my purpose is just learning web development, however,
in the future I'd like to improve implementation, for example using a framework
for frontend (I am thinking trying reactJS or Vuejs). For now, I'd like to
feel myself how the frontend code grows exponentially while adding features.

Basically I am creating an exercises app with the following features:

* Exercises to be done at home
* Predefined exercises routines
* Keep track of progress
* Submit custom exercises routines

# Branching Model Considered

Since this is a learning project, I am also learning git in the process. Since
Git branching is a basic yet powerful feature, I am learning it. I am also in
the attempt of following a good branching model, since this helps development.
For this particular project I am following [this one](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ "A successful git branching model").

First commit. For now, the app only allows user sign-up and logging. I have
implemented REST API (not real REST) for basic functionality.
